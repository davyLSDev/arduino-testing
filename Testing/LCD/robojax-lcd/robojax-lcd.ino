/* Dawson's note at the top
 *  Hardware SPI only works with this Arduino if:
 *  you add this code in: SPI.setClockDivider(SPI_CLOCK_DIV16);
 *  
 *  This I found on the arduino forum: https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=164108.0
 *  
 * this is Arduino code to use Dual axis XY Joystick with Nokia 5110 
 * also read the switch.
 * Other Arduino library and videos http://robojax.com/learn/arduino/
 
 * Watch the video for this code to learn it fully.

Nokia 5100 LCD Example Code
   Graphics driver and PCD8544 interface code for SparkFun's
   84x48 Graphic LCD.
   https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10168
   Original Source code
https://github.com/sparkfun/GraphicLCD_Nokia_5110

  This stuff could all be put into a library, but we wanted to
  leave it all in one sketch to keep it as transparent as possible.

  Hardware: (Note most of these pins can be swapped)
    Graphic LCD Pin ---------- Arduino Pin
       1-VCC       ----------------  5V
       2-GND       ----------------  GND
       3-SCE       ----------------  7
       4-RST       ----------------  6
       5-D/C       ----------------  5
       6-DN(MOSI)  ----------------  11
       7-SCLK      ----------------  13
       8-LED       - 330 Ohm res --  9
   The SCLK, DN(MOSI), must remain where they are, but the other 
   pins can be swapped. The LED pin should remain a PWM-capable
   pin. Don't forget to stick a current-limiting resistor in line
   between the LCD's LED pin and Arduino pin 9!
